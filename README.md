## Predicting Daily Rainfall in Australia using Cloud Implementation

The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning methods to predict the rainfall in Australia's NSW. It presents the use of some tools and technologies relating to big data and cloud computing in order to download, wrangle, analyze, and apply machine learning predictions to a large data set that is difficult to work with using conventional non-scalable implementations.
